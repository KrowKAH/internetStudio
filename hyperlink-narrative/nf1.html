        When your vision fades back in, you're standing in a fancy bedroom, and remember that your father just remarried. Your mom just up and left, leaving you behind as he kindly explained after you enquired on where your mom was,
        after telling you to pack your things to go live with his new girlfriend. You can't believe mom left you, though you'll maybe have a new mom now with dad being happier living with his girlfriend. As you look around your room,
        you wonder if your subpar academic achievements where what drove her away. Maybe you didn't do enough for her to stay, so she left tired of you. As you ponder your choices, both past and present, you can't help but be a little sad and hopeful inside.
        Your mom didn't love you enough to stay, but you now have a new family that can be happier. You just have to be better and not mess up this time. Your vision fades to black once again.
