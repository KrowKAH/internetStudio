        After that last memory had played out, you remembered the rest of your life. While in that lifeless mansion, your father never laid a hand on you again, nor did his girlfriend. In contrast, it was the loneliest time of your life, 
        left by yourself in that empty mansion. No one to talk to, no one to care. They later married to avoid a scandal, and you secretly wondered how long they would last with both of their excelent personalities. 
        As you continue to stand in the darkness, you think it's much more comforting than the lonely, isolated life you ended up living. Always a ghost, just trying to float through life. You don't mind the way it ended, and close your eyes for the final time.
