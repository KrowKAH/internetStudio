        When your vision fades back in, you're standing in a fancy bedroom, and remember that your father just remarried. Your mom just up and left, leaving you behind as he oh so kindly explained after you enquired on where your mom was,
        after telling you to pack your things to go live with his new girlfriend. You don't believe him, neither about your mom's dissapearence or how out of nowhere you're both going to live with his rich new girlfriend. As you look around the lifeless room, 
        you wonder if it was worth it to stay for your mom, when in the end she wasn't there anymore. As you ponder your choices, both past and present, you can't help but break a little inside, wondering if this will be any better. You hope your mom is doing fine, 
        but you don't have high hopes. Your vision fades to black once again.
