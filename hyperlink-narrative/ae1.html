        When your vision fades back in, you look arond the cheap apartment that's falling apart, and feel a little despondent. It wasn't great, but it was yours. You remember what just happened, the funeral home calling to tell you of your mom's death. 
        You don't know why you bothered to think of why your father didn't tell you, it's better to have no expectations when it comes to him. While it's been a few years since you've seen her, you still remember your mom comforting you and trying the best she could.
        Maybe she would have accepted to leave with you once you got an apartment, but that's just wishful thinking. You had already asked, and predicably she ended up staying in that place. 
        How strange, despite feeling quite numb and despondent, you have tears streaming down your face. You wish your mom peace and happiness wherever she is now, and hopes she gets better taste in partners. Your vision fades to black once again.
