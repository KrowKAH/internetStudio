        When you regain your senses, you see yourself in your childhood room, with school work surrounding you everywhere you look, you're a little older again. You remember this, your dad had just talked to you,
        dissappointed in you for not having high enough grades and dragging the family down.
        He would constantly remind you of your burden, saying that you're the reason why everything in his life is miserable now, you don't know how to make it better and up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
        You question if this is all you'll amount to in life, because you've already been a burden to your parents, and you don't know what to do. You need to be there for your mom and help her, and meet dad's expectations so he doesn't worry about you.
        It's all your fault anyways that everything went badly, and mom and dad only want what's best for you. 
        'It's best that I try harder in school and extracurriculars, so that they can be happy.'
        As you ponder what extracurricular to do and how to fit it in your schedule, your vision fades with the end of the memory.
