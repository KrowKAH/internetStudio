        After opening the door you find yourself in a living room. It's familiar, and you remember it from your childhood home. The sounds of arguing draws your attention to the kitchen, where you can see your mom and dad standing and yelling.
        Mom has some colors on her arms from what you can briefly see before dad storms away and she walks over to you and kneels, where you finally realize your small height.

        She cups your face, "My baby, I'm so sorry that you had to hear that, he's just been stressed lately due to his job and doesn't mean anything. While he's stressed, how about we give him some space and stay away for a little bit, alright?
        I love you, my sweet baby."
    </p>
    <p>As she leans down to kiss your forehead your vision briefly fades to black.</p>
