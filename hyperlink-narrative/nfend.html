        After that last memory had played out, you remembered the rest of your life. While living your fancy home, your dad never looked your way, nor did his girlfriend. In contrast, everything was peaceful. Though they were always too busy,
        you didn't mind as they had other important things to focus on. You spent your days achieving the best you could in school and life, always making sure you were in the top and best at what you do, day in and day out. They later got married 
        when they felt it was right, and you were so happy for them and wished the best for your family, hoping this meant they had more time for you.
        As you continue to stand in the darkness, you think it's comforting being surrounded when your parents were always busy. Holidays were a little lonely, though you know they had important things to do and you shouldn't be a burden. 
        You hope your parents aren't too sad with your end, and close your eyes for the final time.
