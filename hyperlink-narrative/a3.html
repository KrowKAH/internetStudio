        When you regain your senses, you see yourself in your childhood room, with school work surrounding you everywhere you look, you're a little older again. You remember this, your father had just berated you for not having high enough grades and dragging the family down.
        Constantly saying that you're the reason why everything in his life is miserable now, you don't know how much more you can take.
    </p>
    <p>
        You question if this really what you'll have to deal with all your life, because you know it's never going to get better at this rate, higher grades or not. You and your mom need to leave this place, and go somewhere safer.
        But she refuses to leave no matter how much you ask, and you don't know what to do.
        'Should I continue to stay here with mom, or end this kind suffering and try to live on my own?'
        As you ponder what to do, your vision fades with the end of the memory.
