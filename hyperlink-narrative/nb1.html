        When your vision fades back in, you're standing in a fancy bedroom, and remember that your father just remarried though you can't help but feel a little despondent. Your mom had just died, leaving you behind as your dad told you
        to pack your things to go live with his new girlfriend. You weren't good enough so mom left you, though you'll maybe have a new mom now with dad being happier living with his girlfriend.<br> As you look around your room,
        you wonder if your subpar academic achievements where what drove her away. You need to be better, so that your family won't leave you, won't have a reson to leave you. As you ponder your choices, both past and present, 
        you can't help but be a little sad and hopeful inside.Your mom didn't love you enough to stay, but you now have a new family that can be happier. <br>
        You just have to be <a class="link-info" href="https://krowkah.github.io/internetStudio/hyperlink-narrative/nbend.html">better</a> and not mess up this time. Your vision fades to black once again.
