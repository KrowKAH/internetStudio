        After that last memory had played out, you remembered the rest of your life. While living your fancy home, due to you not being the best, your dad never looked your way, nor did his girlfriend. In contrast, everything was peaceful. 
        Though they were always too busy and wanting better, you didn't mind as they had other important things to focus on and you weren't living up to their expectations. You spent your days achieving the best you could in school and life, 
        always making sure you were in the top and best at what you do, day in and day out, though you were never good enough. They later got married when they felt it was right, and you were so happy for them and wished the best for them, 
        hoping this meant that you were good enough to be family even though you fail their expectations.
        As you continue to stand in the darkness, you think it's comforting being surrounded and relaxed when you and your parents were always busy. Holidays were a little lonely, though you know they had important things to do and you should have tried to do better. 
        You hope your parents aren't too inconvenienced with your end, and close your eyes for the final time.
