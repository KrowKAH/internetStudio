  <body>
    <p>
        After that last memory had played out, you remembered the rest of your life. You continued on with your life, working from office job to office job, and eventually being able to afford a slightly better apartment. Making ends meet was a constant struggle,
        though you didn't mind it that much as it was better than before, and you had your life to live. You went through life holding onto the small joys that happened, though you were alone. With not much time or interest in mingling with others
        or being social, you continued to spend the rest of your life in solitude. You didn't mind, that was just how your life was.
        As you stand in the darkness, it feels comforting after your lonely, hard-earned life. No one is waiting for you, no one to care. You don't mind the way it ended, and close your eyes for the final time.
