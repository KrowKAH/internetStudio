        As your vision gradually comes back, you immedietly feel yourself getting pushed into the wall and the consequent bruises forming. As you gather more of your bearings you can see that you're still in your living room, though you're a bit taller now, 
        and feel all the aches across your body. Due to still getting re-oriented, you're completly caught off-guard by the next subsequent hit to your head. All your senses are a blurr, and you can't make anything out at all.

        When the dizziness fades you see your mom cradling you with rivers of tears going down her faces as she chants sorry over and over again. The last thing you see before your vision goes black again is the sadness she's enveloped in as she tells you that you're loved.
